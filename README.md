# Milestone Project One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

## Demo
A live demo can be found at https://patcalderon.github.io/milestone-project-one/

## What is it?
It's a website created using User-Centric Frontend Development. I chose to build a website for the artist Dave.

## UX
My goal was to make the design simple and easy to navigate through but yet appealing. The colors I chose were colors that personally are one of my favorites and also very modern and elegant ones.

## Technologies
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap (4.1.3)

## Features
I also used a JavaScript function added to create an "autoresponse" when submitting in my forms. The navigation style I chose to use was a fixed navigation, due to the one page layout design. The fixed navigation allows for a userfriendly experience on this site. There are 5 pages and very easy to maneuver through.

## Features Left to Implement
In the future, I would like to add better UX to my About section when viewed in a mobile. I would like to also add animations to the image in the header.

## Testing
This site was tested mostly in DevTools in Google Chrome, but also across other browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer. And also on mobile and tablet devices (iPhone 7 Plus, 8, iPad Pro with Safari) to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. 
When testing I realized that social media links at the bottom of the footer were placed too much to the left when viewed in a mobile. In that way I could see what the problem was and solved it with some help from DevTools.

## Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The link to the demo is at the top, or you can deploy it here: https://patcalderon.github.io/milestone-project-one/

## Credits
### Content
The About section uses text from Dave's Wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dave_(rapper)

### Media
All photos were taken from Google Images, that includes the background images from every section and also the ones used above the song listed on the Music section. And it is also where found the logo I used in the navbar.
The songs are linked to Spotify and the video is from YouTube.
